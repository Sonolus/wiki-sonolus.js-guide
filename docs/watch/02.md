# 02. Lifetime

In this chapter, we will going over how lifetime of entities are managed in watch mode.

## Timeline and `updateSpawn`

Unlike in play mode where time progresses linearly, players can freely time skip forward and backward in watch mode, and thus it requires a different mechanism for managing lifetime of entities.

Every frame the global `updateSpawn` callback will be called, and the return value will be used as the current "time" of the timeline. Most engines simply return the current time or scaled time.

For our engine, we can return the scaled time:

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}watch/src/engine/watchData/updateSpawn.{2}"

```ts
export const updateSpawn = () => time.scaled
```

```js
export const updateSpawn = () => time.scaled
```

:::

## `spawnTime` and `despawnTime`

For each entity, its `spawnTime` and `despawnTime` callbacks will be called, and the return values are in the same timeline as `updateSpawn` and used as the spawn range of the entity.

Entities will spawn and despawn automatically based on the current time of the timeline. For example, an entity with a spawn range of `100` to `200` will spawn automatically when current time of the timeline advances from `99` to `100`, and will despawn automatically when current time of the timeline advances from `199` to `200`.
