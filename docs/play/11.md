# 11. Note Input

In this chapter, we will implementing input logic of Note.

## Basic Input

Let's first do the very basic input: if player taps, note despawns.

In `touch`, we can loop through touches to look for one that just started. If found, despawn and return.

To prevent note being drawn in `updateParallel` on the frame when it's scheduled to despawn, we add a simple despawn check.

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}play/src/engine/playData/archetypes/Note.{2}"

```ts
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    touch() {
        for (const touch of touches) {
            if (!touch.started) continue

            this.despawn = true
            return
        }
    }

    updateParallel() {
        if (this.despawn) return

        // ...
    }
}
```

```js
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    touch() {
        for (const touch of touches) {
            if (!touch.started) continue

            this.despawn = true
            return
        }
    }

    updateParallel() {
        if (this.despawn) return

        // ...
    }
}
```

## Judgment Windows

While it works now, it definitely isn't the way rhythm games work normally.

A note can only be tapped when the time is in note's judgment windows: if the time is too early, tapping won't trigger it; if the time too late, it's considered a Miss and the note will despawn by itself.

For our engine, let's say if you tap within `50 ms` of the target time you get a Perfect, `100 ms` for Great, `200 ms` for Good, and anything higher is considered not registered/Miss:

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}play/src/engine/playData/windows.{2}"

```ts
export const windows = {
    perfect: Range.one.mul(0.05),
    great: Range.one.mul(0.1),
    good: Range.one.mul(0.2),
}
```

```js
export const windows = {
    perfect: Range.one.mul(0.05),
    great: Range.one.mul(0.1),
    good: Range.one.mul(0.2),
}
```

## Input Offset

When player physically touches the screen, there is a delay until it registers in Sonolus and broadcasts it via `touch` callback. This mostly comes from hardware delay and is unavoidable.

Input offset is what allows players to tell Sonolus to take that into account.

For example, player touches the screen at `00:01.00`, it takes some time and it reaches at `00:01.06`. If player calibrates their input correctly and gives you an input offset of `0.06`, engine can then subtract it from touch time, and correctly judge player based on their real touch time of `00:01.00`.

Input offset is already taken into account in time values of touches by Sonolus. However, other aspects where input is involved, engines still need to do it manually, and ensure a fair gameplay is given to all players.

## Early Input

Let's first calculate the time range player can tap:

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}play/src/engine/playData/archetypes/Note.{2}"

```ts
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    inputTime = this.entityMemory(Range)

    // ...

    initialize() {
        this.inputTime.copyFrom(windows.good.add(this.targetTime).add(input.offset))

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

```js
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    inputTime = this.entityMemory(Range)

    // ...

    initialize() {
        this.inputTime.copyFrom(windows.good.add(this.targetTime).add(input.offset))

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

:::

Then let's make `touch` only run after minimum input time:

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}play/src/engine/playData/archetypes/Note.{2}"

```ts
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    touch() {
        if (time.now < this.inputTime.min) return

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

```js
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    touch() {
        if (time.now < this.inputTime.min) return

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

:::

## Late Input

Let's make note despawn automatically if time is already past maximum input time.

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}play/src/engine/playData/archetypes/Note.{2}"

```ts
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    updateParallel() {
        if (time.now > this.inputTime.max) this.despawn = true
        // ...
    }
}
```

```js
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    updateParallel() {
        if (time.now > this.inputTime.max) this.despawn = true
        // ...
    }
}
```
