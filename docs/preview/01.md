# 01. Overview

In this chapter, we will going through an overview of level preview.

This section of the guide assumes you have already finished previous sections.

## 2D Image

Level preview can best be thought of as a dynamically generated 2D image, where players can then scroll around freely.

Similar to chart viewers of other rhythm games, players often use preview to study patterns without needing to worrying about fast moving gameplay. Thus, it is recommended to include all necessary information such as playable notes, as well as optional information such as BPM.

## Starting Dev Server

Similar to before, run in project directory to start a dev server for preview:

```bash
npm run dev:preview
```
